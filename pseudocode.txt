For order book logic:
********************

INPUT: HASH_MAP module will give you the pricelevel & # of FIFO & the index of order data in that FIFO


if operation = ADD
    find the pricelevel of the order
    call that PRICELEVEL module to add the order;
    run the MATCHING module;
else if operation = MODIFY
    if price of the order is changed: always remove & add
    else if quantity is larger: remove & add;
    else (the quantity is smaller): call the top-level controller to find the pricelevel and adjust the quantity. 

    if HASH_MAP does not find it: set the error flag and do nothing


    remove: CALL the top-level controller to REMOVE the order in that location

    add: do the same for ADD;

else if operation = CANCEL

    if HASH_MAP does not find it: set the error flag and do nothing

    remove: CALL the top-level controller to REMOVE the order in that location
